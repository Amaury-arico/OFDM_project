## Step 1

a) FFT/IFFT and true channel equalization with noise
b) BER comparison with AWGN only - no multipath / with multipath - no EQ / with multipath and EQ / with channel delay longer than Cycle prefix length

## Step 2

a) Channel estimation in frequency domain and time domain (Fourier matrix truncated considering CP elements for impulse function)
b) BER results
c) Normalized MSE comparing channel computed with 2 methods and the true channel

## Step 3

Time shift impact and correction with preamble detection

## Step 4

a) CFO impact and correction with preamble detection
b) MSE computation for CFO estimation in function of SNR
c) CFO residual correction with pilot symbols

## Step 5

Muli-received-antenna impact -> diversity + array gain in case of multiple realisations
