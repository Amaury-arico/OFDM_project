## Step 1

a) FFT/IFFT and true channel equalization with noise
b) BER comparison with AWGN only - no multipath / with multipath - no EQ / with multipath and EQ / with channel delay longer than Cycle prefix length

## Step 2

a) Channel estimation in frequency domain and time domain (Fourier matrix truncated considering CP elements for impulse function)
b) BER results
c) Normalized MSE comparing channel computed with 2 methods and the true channel
